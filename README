DESCRIPTION
    This application provides indexing and searching capabilities for your
    personal photo library. The built-in functionality is specifically
    targetted towards a photo library that is managed by Picasa and how that
    photo management application stores its captions, tags and name
    information.

    Important: For name tags, make sure that you have selected the "Store
    Name Tags in Photo" option (introduced in Picasa 3.9) as this
    application will not read any of the ".picasa.ini" files that were
    previously used to store that information.

    The program can be invoked like so:

            % imdex [global options] [sub-command] [sub-command-options] [sub-command-arguments]

    Running the "imdex" executable with no sub-command will output a help
    screen listing the available commands. You may also use the "help"
    sub-command to get specific help for any of the sub-commands available.
    For instance:

            % imdex help search

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    *   "-d" or "--database"

        This tells "imdex" where to find the SQLite database it uses for its
        indexing/searching operations. By default, this will be in your home
        directory (i.e. "~/.imdex.db") and will be created the first time
        the "index" operation is run.

SUB-COMMANDS
    *   index

        This command will index the list of files specified on the
        command-line. It does not currently doing any directory recursion so
        you will need to pair this up with "find" or some other utility that
        will do that for you. See Imdex::Command::index for more
        information.

    *   search

        Naturally, this command will search the index built by the "index"
        command. Various arguments are supported as demonstrated in the
        "SYNOPSIS" above as well as the Imdex::Command::search
        documentation.

    *   info

        This command dumps out the indexed information for files specified
        on the command line. See Imdex::Command::info for more information.

    *   clean

        Removes the Imdex database. See Imdex::Command::clean for more
        information.

TODO
    *   Support for a persistent config file to avoid needing to specify
        where the database is located with every invocation

    *   Improve (and optimize) color grouping/recognition process

    *   Provide more flexible query options

    *   Implement duplicate image checking
