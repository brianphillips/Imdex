=head1 DESCRIPTION

This application provides indexing and searching capabilities for your
personal photo library.  The built-in functionality is specifically
targetted towards a photo library that is managed by Picasa and how
that photo management application stores its captions, tags and name
information.

B<Important:> For name tags, make sure that you have selected the "Store Name Tags in
Photo" option (introduced in Picasa 3.9) as this application will not
read any of the C<.picasa.ini> files that were previously used to store
that information.

The program can be invoked like so:

	% imdex [global options] [sub-command] [sub-command-options] [sub-command-arguments]

Running the C<imdex> executable with no sub-command will output a help screen
listing the available commands.  You may also use the C<help> sub-command
to get specific help for any of the sub-commands available.  For instance:

	% imdex help search

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item * C<-d> or C<--database>

This tells C<imdex> where to find the SQLite database it uses for its
indexing/searching operations.  By default, this will be in your home
directory (i.e. C<~/.imdex.db>) and will be created the first time the
C<index> operation is run.

=head1 SUB-COMMANDS

=over 4

=item * index

This command will index the list of files specified on the command-line.
It does not currently doing any directory recursion so you will need to
pair this up with C<find> or some other utility that will do that for you.
See L<Imdex::Command::index> for more information.

=item * search

Naturally, this command will search the index built by the C<index>
command. Various arguments are supported as demonstrated in the
C<SYNOPSIS> above as well as the L<Imdex::Command::search> documentation.

=item * info

This command dumps out the indexed information for files specified on
the command line.  See L<Imdex::Command::info> for more information.

=item * clean

Removes the Imdex database.  See L<Imdex::Command::clean> for more information.
